--If you want to create a vector line outside a building (or lets say a place visible from a bird's eye), 
--then jump to the line number 43. Otherwise, if you want to use a basemap/base-image to create your vector
--line onto then follow from the begining.

--1. Open QGIS (which is belived to be installed on your system, in order to perform some initial processing).
--This GIS Data handling and processing software is open source software and can be downloaded easily from the
--following website:
http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html

--2. Select the tool Georeferencer from the topmost toolbar.
Raster < Georeferencer < Georeferencer

--3. Open your base-image into the newly open window (use CRS WGS84 if your coordinates are not projected) and
--then click on all the GCP's locations for which you know the exact lat-long.

--4. Feed the X/East/Long and Y/North/Lat values for all these points.

--5. In the transformation settings select the 'Polynomial 1' as the Transformation type if you have limited 
--number of GCPs and 'Nearest Neighbour' as the Resampling method.

--6. Save the data in GeoTIFF format and import into the QGIS main window.

--7. Create a new vector layer from the topmost toolbar.
Layer < New < New Shapefile Layer...

--8. Specify the Type as a 'Line' and CRS 'WGS84'. Save it as a tif file and import into the QGIS main window.

--9. Start editing this Line vector layer.
Layers Panel < Right Click < Toggle Editing

--10. Select the add feature tool to add the Line features on top of your georeferenced base-image. Save it 
--after the drawing and delete all the columns from the 'Open Attribute Table' before again selecting the 
--'Toggle Editing' tool in order to stop editing.

--11. Finally saveas this layer in order to make it importable for our JOSM-gui.
Right Click the layer < Save As... < Format (GPS eXchange Format [GPX])

--12. Leave the other fields default and save it at a safe directory.

--In order to make a vector line (for future export as an .osm file format), you need a basemap/base-image. 
--Follow the following steps.

--1. If you want to use the OSM as your basemap then just open the OSM imagery from the top toolbar
Imagery < OpenStreetMap (Mapnik)

--2. If your base-image cannot be visible from the Bird's eye, then use the Line vector file we have created in 
--the above section. JOSM supports very limited variety of file formats to import (mainly XML format). But we can use 
--the .GPX file format to import our Line vector file as a base-image. Why we are importing this Line vector file is 
--because we need a reference map to create our vector line onto using the JOSM.

--3. Open the .GPX file
File < Open... < select .GPX file

--4. Create a new layer
File < New Layer

--5. One can see both the layers in the right 'Layers' panel.

--6. Start editing this newly created layer by Activating it (green right tick must be visible) and selecting the 
--'Draw nodes (A)' tool from the left panel. Just run the line on top of the base-image line (or on the road / areas of 
--interest in case of the OSM).

--7. Once done, saveas the layer in .osm file format from the rightside Layers panel.
Right Click < Save As...
